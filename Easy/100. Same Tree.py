"""
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they
are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical,
and the nodes have the same value.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
